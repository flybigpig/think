To compile and run these programs, you only need JDK 8 installed. 
Invoking `gradlew` will automatically download and install Gradle.
Gradle will also install all additional libraries necessary to compile
and run the Java examples in the book.

To compile and run everything, the command is:

`gradlew run`

If you are on a Unix/Linux based system, you must select the local directory for all commands, for example:

`./gradlew run`

To only compile everything, the command is:

`gradlew compileJava`

To compile only a single chapter (including dependencies), use for example:

`gradlew :strings:compileJava`

To run only a single chapter, say:

`gradlew :strings:run`

Gradle can also be used to run a single program. Here, we run the **ReplacingStringTokenizer.java**
program in the **strings** chapter subdirectory:

`gradlew  :strings:ReplacingStringTokenizer`

However, if the file name is unique throughout the book (the majority are), you can just give the
program name, like this:

`gradlew  ReplacingStringTokenizer`

Note that all commands are run from the base directory where the example code is installed, and where you find the
`gradlew` script.

You can learn about other options by just typing `gradlew` with no arguments.
